    "These columns are *not* integral to the STV process; however, they increase transparency and confidence in the process. The details of these are explained in [*Practical Advice for a Better World*](https://benleboutillier.com/books/Practical_Advice).\n",
    "* ***Ballot_ID*** is a unique identifier for each submitted ballot. Only the voter knows his or her own *Ballot_ID*, as it is automatically-generated when the ballot is submitted. The presence of such a number allows all ballot submissions to be made publically available, since they cannot be traced back to any voter. Such transparency allows each voter to view the accumulated submissions--online, at polling locations, or elsewhere--and verify that his or her vote has been recorded accurately.\n",
    "* ***Is_Challenged*** is a True/False column for whether or not a voter has challenged the accuracy of a ballot submission. Voters have a window of time in which to view the ballot submissions and raise a challenge. A challenge requires a voter to bring his or her voting receipt to an appropriate location. The receipt (i.e., printout of one's submitted ballot received before exiting polling location) has the *Ballot_ID* and accurate results. With the accurate information, updates can be made.\n",
    "* ***Is_Resolved*** is updated by *the voter* to confirm that a challenge has been fixed. This column is `None` for unchallenged ballots, but `True` or `False` for challenged ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this example, approximately 5% of ballot submissions (randomly chosen) are challenged, and all challenges have been resolved.\n"

    "# Outstanding Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these questions are answered in [*Practical Advice for a Better World*](https://benleboutillier.com/books/Practical_Advice) or the code within [Election.py](./Election.py). Nevertheless, as STV has many moving parts, they are always worth repeating:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Why iterate? Doesn't the person with the most votes win?***\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Iterations are only necessary *if no candidate has enough votes to win*. That said, if a candidate receives more than 50% of the votes during the first tally, the process stops there and that person wins. If a second iteration happens and *then* a candidate has 50% or more, the algorithm stops there--at iteration 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Because of the way votes are randomly distributed in this example, many iterations are needed. In reality, some people are more popular than others and will have more people vote for them. These people might accumulate enough votes after just a few iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***What happens to a ballot if all its choices have been dropped?***\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If every candidate you've ranked has been dropped by the process, then your ballot will not be considered in future iterations. Although wild-sounding at first, doesn't this make the most sense?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If I vote for Candidate A and don't include second, third, fourth, etc. choices . . . and Candidate A receives the least votes and is dropped, then what *should* happen? By ranking the way I have, I effectively say that if it can't be Candidate A, then I don't have a vote to give / don't care. This is exactly how the algorithm treats it. Indeed, my vote ***should not*** go to a random person, nor the leading person, nor the lagging person; it should go to the people I choose or no one at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Why does the final count sum to less than the total ballots?***\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some voters do not rank all candidates. Citing the question above, if all the candidates that a voter has ranked have been dropped in the process, then--when that ballot is out of ranked candidates--the ballot is removed from the pool. Accordingly, each iteration will see the total count decrease. That is, if I rank Candidate A only, and then Candidate A is dropped, thereafter I don't have a vote to give to anyone. The total votes decreases because mine is no longer a part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Of course, the 50% of votes needed refers to the number of votes considered *in each iteration*. At the first iteration, if there are 10,000 votes, then a candidate needs 5,001 votes or more to win. If, in the second iteration, there are only 9,800 votes still being considered, >50% equates to 4,901 votes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***What if I don't have first choices, but definitely have a last choice?***\n",
    "\n",
    "    So you don't care who wins . . . except definitely not Candidate H? In this case, to bottom-rank a candidate, put that person last and then randomly fill in the other candidates. This is, after all, the logic behind bottom-ranking: Any random person in any order, but Candidate H last. The algorithm won't do this automatically for you, so you have to do it yourself. Put that person you detest last, and then randomly place others higher up."
